# NftMetadataIndexerDevX

## Description

A collection of Solidity smart contracts implementing a novel NFT fractionalization and re-aggregation protocol, utilizing Merkle tree proofs for efficient ownership verification and reduced on-chain storage.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) by subscribing to relevant event logs and state changes.
- Implements a distributed caching layer using Redis for low-latency metadata retrieval based on token ID and contract address.
- Provides a GraphQL API endpoint for querying NFT metadata, including support for pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- Automatically detects and parses various NFT metadata standards (ERC-721, ERC-1155, and Metaplex) using schema validation.
- Supports custom metadata enrichment through configurable plugins that can fetch data from external APIs and databases.
- Employs a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to handle high-volume NFT minting and transfer events asynchronously.
- Tracks historical NFT metadata changes by storing previous versions in a versioned database (e.g., PostgreSQL with temporal tables).
- Generates real-time alerts for metadata updates and anomalies using machine learning techniques to detect suspicious patterns.
